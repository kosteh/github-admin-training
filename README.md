## Notes
- Public (e.g. Open Source) Kadaster repositories need a **License File** in **each repository**. Think of Legal consequences. A link to this license file appers in the repository menu on the right.
- Service account (Jenkins) need a license. Therefore use deployment keys for the repository.
- In cloud, Github pages are public. In future they can be readable only by Kadaster employees. 
- Internal repo's can only be read by Kadaster internal employees. Accept when collaborators are added. 
- File "Code Owner" file (https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-code-owners)
- Dependabot ....
- Put Open Source projects in a specific organisation ....
- Enable "Keep my email addresses private" setting (under profile settings)
